# Echo Valley
This is the write-up for the challenge "Echo Valley" in PicoCTF

# The Challenge
## Description
The echo valley is a simple function that echoes back whatever you say to it.
But how do you make it respond with something more interesting, like a flag?
Download the source: valley.c
Download the binary: valley
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Hints
Ever heard of a format string attack?

## Initial look
Looking at valley.c, in the echo_valley() function we can see a **format string vlunerability**:

`printf(buf);`

There is also a `print_flag()` function that isn't called anywhere, so it must be that we need to call it.


# How to solve it
Lets verify the format string vulnerability.

We input:
`%p::%p::%p::%p::%p::%p::%p::%p`

Good. Now that we confirmed the vulnerability, lets run valley (the binary file) in gdb and
# ðŸŽ‰ Flag
